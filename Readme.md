# SideFX Houdini Licenses Server Docker Image

**LEGAL NOTICES:**
*You must provide your own licenses, this only provides a way to host them for your workstation/render environment. The build script will also automatically accept the [SideFX EULA](https://www.sidefx.com/services/eula/), so please make sure you have read that and agree to it. By running the script you are effectively accepting it.*

Clone repo to a local directory and execute `docker build -t sidefx-hkey-docker .` to build your docker image. I don't have licensing to upload this image, hence the instructions to build your own.

The service runs on port the default `1715`.

A mount volume is needed for `/usr/lib/sesi-docker`. In my following example laucnh command I'm mapping/binding to a local directory, `~/sesi`. **This is important so that your licenses remain if your docker instance restart/shuts down.**

**Launch command**: `docker run -d -p 1715:1715 --name=<DockerInstanceName> --hostname=<server.fqdn.com> -v ~/sesi/licenses:/usr/lib/sesi/licenses sidefx-hkey-docker:latest`

**Use at your own risk, there are no guarantees on this!**
